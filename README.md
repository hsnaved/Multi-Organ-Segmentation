# Multi-Organ-Segmentation
**Overview**

This project involves creating a mobile application for multi-organ segmentation in abdominal CT images using advanced deep learning architectures, including the UNETR model, which combines Vision Transformers and CNNs for enhanced segmentation accuracy. The application allows users to segment organs and visualize segmentation results on a mobile interface, integrating deep learning algorithms with a user-friendly app.
